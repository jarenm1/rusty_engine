# About 
`rusty_engine` is a simple rust game engine using winit and wgpu.
This engine currently is not in a usable state. 

As I am working, I type out my thought process to help me think, I will do my best not to delete these comments and leave these in to show my thoughts when creating the engine. There are tons in the ECS code currently.

Currently working on the ECS. Archetype based approach. spawn! marco to create entities, entities are the key used to query and transform components tied to the entity.

## Goal
Will change scope based on how I feel. Currently the end goal is 2d sprite engine.
