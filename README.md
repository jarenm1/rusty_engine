# About 
`rusty_engine` is a simple rust game engine using winit and wgpu.
This engine currently is not in a usable state. 
The ecs implementation will likely be very slow, but is an archetype based implementation and is currently unfinished.
The rendering is able to render the classic triangle and images.


## Goal
The goal is for `rusty_engine` to be a 2d gane engine with full sprite and animation support. The engine will be ECS driven. Similar to bevy, the engine lets you make startup and update functinos anywhere.
